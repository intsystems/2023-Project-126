Abstract
========

Language models are improving their ability to detect whether the entire text was generated or written by human. This paper considers the problem of detecting machine-generated parts of text in the document. We introduce a model, that can detect such text fragments and distinguish their origin among several language models. To solve this problem we combine two models. The objective of the first one is to divide document into fragments of human-written text and machine-generated text. The second model aims to classify the generated fragments according to the language model from which they were obtained. In the computational experiment, we analyse the quality of such approach on dataset of documents with fragments generated by GPT-2 and GPT-3.
