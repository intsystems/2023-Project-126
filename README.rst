Abstract
========

This paper considers the problem of detecting machine-generated parts of text in the document. We introduce a model, that can detect such text fragments and distinguish their origin among several language models. To solve this problem we combine two models. The objective of the first one is to divide document into fragments of human-written text and machine-generated text. The second model aims to classify the generated fragments according to the language model from which they were obtained. In the computational experiment, we analyse the quality of such approach on dataset of documents with fragments generated by GPT-2 and GPT-3.

     - The main reasons why it's so hard to launch a rocketship are: There is a lot of gravity between the two launch sites - especially if they are in polar orbit, which is where you want to go for cheaper rockets. You have to make sure your engine can overcome this and that you have enough fuel to get out of Earth's gravity well.Launching from near the equator maximizes the amount of available rocketry (thrust) per kg of payload, which means it costs less. In order to launch a satellite in polar orbit and not waste all the thrust you got for free on your ascent, you need to have some crazy amount of fuel - at least 2/3rds the mass of the entire rocketship (assuming an ideal engine).
