    :Название исследуемой задачи: Detection of machine-generated fragments in text

Abstract
========

This paper considers the problem of detecting machine-generated parts of text in the document. We introduce a model, that can detect such text fragments and distinguish their origin among several language models. To solve this problem we combine two models. The objective of the first one is to divide document into fragments of human-written text and machine-generated text. The second model aims to classify the generated fragments according to the language model from which they were obtained. In the computational experiment, we analyse the quality of such approach on dataset of documents with fragments generated by GPT-2 and GPT-3.

     - The main reasons why it's so hard to launch a rocketship are: There is a lot of gravity between the two launch sites - especially if they are in polar orbit, which is where you want to go for cheaper rockets. You have to make sure your engine can overcome this and that you have enough fuel to get out of Earth's gravity well.Launching from near the equator maximizes the amount of available rocketry (thrust) per kg of payload, which means it costs less. In order to launch a satellite in polar orbit and not waste all the thrust you got for free on your ascent, you need to have some crazy amount of fuel - at least 2/3rds the mass of the entire rocketship (assuming an ideal engine).

     - Rocketships are incredibly difficult to launch due to their complexity and cost, as well as the need for specialized facilities. Firstly, rockets require complex engineering in order to be able to withstand takeoff and flight conditions while also being powerful enough to reach orbit or a desired destination. Secondly, they can often cost hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars due to their complexity and number of components involved. Last but certainly not least, launching rockets requires access to specialized facilities such as spaceports which are usually limited in numbers around the world. All these factors make rocketships a challenging endeavor for any company or organization looking to reach orbit or beyond.

     - The main reasons why it's so hard to launch a rocketship are the following: The rocket is too big and heavy for its own weight, which makes launching from orbit impossible (it would be very difficult).  This problem can also occur with other types of satellites such as balloons or even small drones that have been launched by humans in space before they reach their destination - this means there will always some risk involved when trying out new technologies like these on Earth; but if you're going into an area where people might not want your technology then don't do anything risky until after all launches were completed successfully!

     - The main reasons why it is so hard to launch a rocketship are:\1. It’s not easy for the average person (or even an expert) to understand how rocket engines work, and what they do in spaceflight operations; 2. There aren't many people who have experience with building or operating them on Earth - which means that there isn't much of any practical knowledge about their operation available anywhere else but NASA itself! This makes things very difficult when trying to figure out exactly where something went wrong during testing at one point because you don&apos; t know if your assumptions were correct enough before starting up again after fixing whatever problem occurred last time around... Or worse yet- If someone has already tried this exact same thing multiple times without success then chances increase exponentially as more attempts occur over longer periods until eventually failure occurs due lack Of sufficient understanding between all parties involved regarding proper procedure
